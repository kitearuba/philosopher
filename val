üí° Note: For the '1000 philosophers' stress test, both exit 0 (philosopher died and simulation ended) and exit 124 (timed out without errors) are considered valid.
üí° Tip: Use longer timing or more CPUs to reduce early philosopher deaths if needed.

üîç VALGRIND MEMORY LEAK TEST (slows performance)
‚ö† This test may delay thread timing and is only meant to detect memory leaks. Not suitable for timing tests.
Running: valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./philo 5 800 200 200 3
‚úò Memory leak detected:
